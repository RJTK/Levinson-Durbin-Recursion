# Whittle Levinson Durbin Recursion

This package implements the Levinson-Durbin recursion as well as
Whittle's block-toeplitz generalization for all-pole VAR(p) models.
These algorithms are fundamental for stationary time series analysis.

In particular, suppose we have samples x(t) for t = 1, ..., T of a
vector wide-sense stationary time series where x(t) lives in R^n.
After estimating the autocovariance at lags 0 through p, We
facilitate estimating `p` all-pole models of orders 1, 2, ..., p and
returning the error achieved all for the cost of solving a single
linear np x np hermitian-toeplitz system (i.e. O(n^2 p^2) time).  This
is extremely useful for efficient model order selection.

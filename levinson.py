    Comsumes a length p + 1 vector r = [r(0), ..., r(p)] and returns
    (a, G, eps) as follows:

    returns:
      - a (np.array): Length p + 1 array (with a[0] = 1.0) consisting
        of the filter coefficients for an all-pole model of a signal
        having autocovariance r.
      - G (np.array): Length p array of reflection coefficients.
        It is guaranteed that |G[tau]| <= 1.
      - eps (float): The error achieved by the all-pole model.  eps is
        guaranteed to satisfy eps >= 0.

    NOTE: We don't handle complex data

    We get a solution to the system R @ a = eps * e1 where R = toep(r)
    and e1 is the first canonical basis vector.  The variables are a[1:]
    and eps.

    One of the key advantages of this algorithm is that the resulting
    filter is guaranteed to be stable, and the prediction error is directly
    available as a byproduct.

    Moreover, the sequence G has the property forall tau: |G(tau)| < 1.0
    if and only if r is a positive definite covariance sequence.

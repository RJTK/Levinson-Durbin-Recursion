    Comsumes a length p + 1 vector r = [r(0), ..., r(p)] and returns
    (a, G, eps) as follows:

    returns:
      - a (np.array): Length p + 1 array (with a[0] = 1.0) consisting
        of the filter coefficients for an all-pole model of a signal
        having autocovariance r.
      - G (np.array): Length p array of reflection coefficients.
        It is guaranteed that |G[tau]| <= 1.
      - eps (np.array): The sequence of errors achieved by all-pole
        models of progressively larger order.  eps is guaranteed to
        satisfy eps >= 0.

    NOTE: We don't handle complex data

    We get a solution to the system R @ a = eps * e1 where R = toep(r)
    and e1 is the first canonical basis vector.  The variables are a[1:]
    and eps.  NOTE: For epsilon we are returning a sequence of errors for
    progressively larger systems.

    One of the key advantages of this algorithm is that the resulting
    filter is guaranteed to be stable, and the prediction error is directly
    available as a byproduct.

    Moreover, the sequence G has the property forall tau: |G(tau)| < 1.0
    if and only if r is a positive definite covariance sequence.
